# domoticz-homeautomation-workbook
Workbook on how to build a Domoticz Home Automation System on a Raspberry Pi.

As a Domoticz Beginner
* Main Purpose is to explore & learn Domoticz & Scripting.
* Get an initial Home Automation Solution up & running.
* Write up experiences during development … and build further.

***Notes***
There might be better solutions for what is shared – but the solution works fine so far.

This document is a working document – todo’s will never cease to exist 😊.

### Functions
* Display temperature & humidity measured in rooms.
* Charts for selective weather items, room temperature & humidity.
* Control Somfy roller shutters with RTS motors in rooms.
* Philips Hue Lighting System control via Hue Bridge for ZigBee devices.
* Security door & window wireless contact detectors.
* Information on some key dates (Calendar type information).
* MQTT subscribe & publish messages to trigger actions or information.
* Raspberry Pi system information with charts and threshold email notification.
* Energy Power Consumption metering from “volkszaehler” with charts.
* More features are added whilst exploring Domoticz

### Explore How To
* Setup & configure Domoticz running on a Raspberry Pi.
* Use the RFXCOM RFXtrx433E USB RF Transceiver for
* Temperature & Humidity devices.
* External Wind device (only for RFXCOM tests).
* Other 433Mhz devices, i.e. door & window contacts.
* Use external services, i.e. OpenWeatherMap.
* Use MQTT messaging.
* Use bindings like MQTT, Astro, Philips Hue.
* Use Node-RED as an alternative script engine and User Interface.
* Use a, to be determined, Domoticz Android App (native client).
* Create advanced User Interfaces, i.e. Node-RED, Bootstrap …
* Scripting using Python, Lua, dzVents, JavaScript.

### Credits
To the developers of Domoticz and to all sharing information about Domoticz. Without these, it would not be possible to build this project and write the workbook.
